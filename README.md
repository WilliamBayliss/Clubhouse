# README

A simple clubhouse-style website where you can sign up and make posts. Posts are anonymous unless the user is signed in.

Project has not been deployed to heroku, if you want to try it out download the repo and run it locally on your machine by running $ rails server in the main directory.

Try signing up with the Sign Up button in the top right, and then when you're redirected to the main page you can navigate to the New Post page via a dropdown menu from the button with your username. Make a couple of posts, sign out and they should be anonymous!

Gained experience with user authentication and the devise gem, some experience creating model associations with Active Record and some experience with a few new gems like Bulma for CSS classes.

TODO in the future: allow commenting on posts, UI improvements, user profiles

Made for the Odin Project, project link:
